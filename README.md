# Injured Android Testing Lab
Injured Android is a CTF-like application designed for mobile penetration testing. It provides a controlled environment for testing Android application security through real-world exploitation techniques.
Dette holder seg tro til originalen, men med litt bedre flyt.

The **purpose** of this testing is to improve mobile penetration testing skills ahead of my bachelor's thesis.
